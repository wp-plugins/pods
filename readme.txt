Pods is a CMS (Content Management System) plugin for WordPress.

== Description ==

Pods lets you create, manage, and display custom content types using WordPress. Like Drupal CCK, these content types can relate to one another, allowing for sites packed with interconnectedness. Automatic pagination, filtering, public forms, access control, menu editing and more are possible with the Pods CMS plugin. If you've been looking for a clean, lightweight alternative to Drupal/CCK or Joomla, then look no further.
