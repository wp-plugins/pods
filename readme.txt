Pods is a Wordpress plugin that adds CMS abilities to blog posts.

== Description ==

Pods is a CMS (Content Management System) plugin for Wordpress. It allows users to add **content types**, associate content types with posts, and form relationships among blog posts.

A content type, or **pod**, is a simply a container of information. It allows items to be categorized in a much more structured and flexible manner than through tagging alone.

For example, we'll create 2 pods: **person** and **automobile**. The **automobile** pod could contain relevant fields (*make*, *model*, *year*, *mpg*, and *owner*). The cool part about Pods is that we could set the *owner* field as a relationship with the **person** content type.

Posts can be interrelated with other posts of that same content type, as well as with any other content type(s). This aspect of a "web of related content" is the heart of any modern CMS.

== Installation ==

1. Download the latest release
2. Unzip the contents to wp-content/plugins/ (resulting in wp-content/plugins/pods)
3. Move the .htaccess file from wp-content/plugins/pods to the Wordpress root directory
