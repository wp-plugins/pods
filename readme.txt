Pods is a CMS (Content Management System) plugin for WordPress.

== Description ==

Pods is a CMS plugin that allows for the creation and management of content types (pods). Unlike Custom Fields, Pods allows you to create actual relationships among content types. With support for relationships, you're free to create a highly interconnected site with the simplicity you'd expect from WordPress. If you've been looking for a clean, lightweight alternative to Drupal/CCK or Joomla, then look no further.

Pods includes several other helpful features: PodPages (custom pages with wildcard support), full access control, a complete Menu Editor (for building top-level and local navs), an intuitive content browser, and much more.
